I am a postdoctoral researcher at [HCI Sorbonne](https://hci.isir.upmc.fr/), Institute for Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR), Sorbonne University, France.
I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany.
During my PhD, I worked at

  * the [HCI Labs](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/hci/hci_tuda/index.en.jsp), TU Darmstadt, Germany
  * (research stay) the [Human-Centred Computing Section](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/human-centred-computing/), University of Copenhagen, Denmark
  * the [DIVA Group](https://diva.telecom-paristech.fr/), Télécom Paris, France

My research interest is situated at the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Cognitive Science. For more details, please see my [research](projects.html).


<!-- My current research interest focuses on understanding people's cognitive and behavioral processes in the dual-environment paradigm from the VR perspective by conducting experiments.  -->
<!-- Additionally, I design interaction techniques to reduce collisions with the real-world environment and explore future safety mechanisms in VR. -->
<!-- In 2019, I completed my Master's degree at National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. Our projects explored integrating input controls and haptic outputs with VR head-mounted displays. -->
